# Lynx.js

Lynx.js is a lightweight ⚖️, and speedy ⚡️ Node.js library for building webservers 🌐. Using it, you easily use the built in modules of Node.js to its full potential 💫. Create APIs, build middleware, serve files, and more with Lynx.js.

## Installation

Currently, there isn't a easy solution for installing, and although we do plan on making an NPM package 📦, it's not yet ready for public use. We apologize for the inconvenience 😔, but as for now, you'll need to install Lynx.js manually 🧑‍💻 using `git clone`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanLikesCoding/Lynx.js.git
```

## Usage

Currently, proper documentation has not been made 📄, althought it would be appreciated 🙏 if you could make pull requests to do so.

### Starting a Server

Before we begin to build a wonderful🎉 website with Lynx.js, we will first have to configure our server. To do so, we will need to import the `Server` class. Next, we will initialize the Server class with a config object. Currently, our config object only has one property, `port`, which is the port that our server will listen on. But this will change in the future. Finally, to start the server, we can call the `run` method on our Server instance.

```js
const Server = require('Lynx.js');

const app = new Server({
  port: 3000
});

app.run();
```

### Serving a Route

To serve a route using Lynx.js, we will call a method on our Server instance. The method we call will depend on the type of route we are serving. Lynx.js currently supports 4 different methods 💪: `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`.  
Below is an example of what you can do with these methods.

```js
const Server = require('Lynx.js');

const app = new Server({
   port: 3000
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!'); // The method res.send will send a response to the client.
});

app.get('/file', (req, res) => {
  res.file('./index.html'); // The method res.file is for serving files.
});

app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    name: 'Alan',
    age: '21'
  }); // The method res.json is for sending JSON data.
  // Note: You can use req.body.[method] to get the body of the request.
});
app.get('/render', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index.html'); // The method res.render is for rendering templates. More on that later
});

app.run();
```

### Serving a Static Directory

To serve a static directory, you use the `static` method of the Server instance, which takes one parameter, the path to the directory, like so.
```js
const Server = require('Lynx.js');

const app = new Server({
  port: 3000
});

app.static('./static'); // The method app.static is for serving static directories.

app.run();
```

### Middleware
To use middleware, you use the `use` method of the Server instance, which takes one parameter, the middleware function.
```js
const Server = require('Lynx.js');

const app = new Server({
  port: 3000
});

app.use((req, res) => {
  console.log('Request received');
});
```

### Rendering
Have you ever wanted to render data from your server directly onto a html template? Well now you can with `res.render`! 😀 The method takes two parameters, the path to the template, and an object of data to pass to the template.

Below is an example, although keep in mind this doesnt include the server initialization, etc. to save space 👍.

`main.js`
```js
app.get('/render', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index.html', {
    name: 'Joe',
    age: '21'
  });
});
```

`index.html`
```html
<h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
<p>You are {{age}} years old.</p>
```
